## About

The AI landscape evolves rapidly. What was cutting-edge last month may be outdated today. This repository serves as a living chronicle of AI developments—sourced from Twitter/X, official announcements, and community contributions.

**Why this exists:**
- AI knowledge has a short half-life (~30 days for many developments)
- Twitter/X has become a primary source for AI news and insights
- A structured timeline helps track what actually matters
